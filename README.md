- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... bigonionbots@gmail.com, @Big Onion#2519 on Discord, @bigonionbots on Twitter

I'll be adding some of the Discord bots I've done in Nodejs/Discordjs.  To see them in action you are welcome to join The Onion Patch on Discord (https://discord.gg/SgGDVVHwUj).  I'll be happy to connect with you there if you have questions or requests.

Code to be added:

-Price Bot - Utilizes APIs from Coingecko, Coinmarketcap, LiveCoinWatch, Dexscreen, DexGuru, and Vestige (for Algorand ASAs) to display crypto prices; single script manages over individual 30 bots 
-Net Bot - Makes use of Minerstat's API to provide information on network hashrate and difficulty for a variety of PoW crypto projects.
-Gas Bot - Currently only supports ETH network fast/normal/slow current gas prices, but will be expanding to include other blockchains
